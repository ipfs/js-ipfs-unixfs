# About

<!--

!IMPORTANT!

Everything in this README between "# About" and "# Install" is automatically
generated and will be overwritten the next time the doc generator is run.

To make changes to this section, please update the @packageDocumentation section
of src/index.js or src/index.ts

To experiment with formatting, please run "npm run docs" from the root of this
repo and examine the changes made.

-->

## Example

Let's create a little directory to import:

```console
> cd /tmp
> mkdir foo
> echo 'hello' > foo/bar
> echo 'world' > foo/quux
```

And write the importing logic:

```js
import { importer } from 'ipfs-unixfs-importer'
import { MemoryBlockstore } from 'blockstore-core/memory'
import * as fs from 'node:fs'

// Where the blocks will be stored
const blockstore = new MemoryBlockstore()

// Import path /tmp/foo/
const source = [{
  path: '/tmp/foo/bar',
  content: fs.createReadStream('/tmp/foo/bar')
}, {
  path: '/tmp/foo/quxx',
  content: fs.createReadStream('/tmp/foo/quux')
}]

for await (const entry of importer(source, blockstore)) {
  console.info(entry)
}
```

When run, metadata about DAGNodes in the created tree is printed until the root:

```js
{
  cid: CID, // see https://github.com/multiformats/js-cid
  path: 'tmp/foo/bar',
  unixfs: UnixFS // see https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs
}
{
  cid: CID, // see https://github.com/multiformats/js-cid
  path: 'tmp/foo/quxx',
  unixfs: UnixFS // see https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs
}
{
  cid: CID, // see https://github.com/multiformats/js-cid
  path: 'tmp/foo',
  unixfs: UnixFS // see https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs
}
{
  cid: CID, // see https://github.com/multiformats/js-cid
  path: 'tmp',
  unixfs: UnixFS // see https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs
}
```
